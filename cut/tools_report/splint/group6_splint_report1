vaccination_drive_main.c: (in function main)
vaccination_drive_main.c:11:8: Variable choice used before definition
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some execution
  path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)
vaccination_drive_main.c:19:3: Return value (type int) ignored:
                                  scanf("%d", &choice)
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalint to inhibit warning)

vaccination_drive_main.c:31:2: Path with no return in function declared to
                                  return int
  There is a path through a function declared to return a value on which there
  is no return statement. This means the execution may fall through without
  returning a meaningful result to the caller. (Use -noret to inhibit warning)
vaccination_drive_main.c:7:7: Variable admin_pass declared but not used
  A variable is declared but never used. Use /*@unused@*/ in front of
  declaration to suppress message. (Use -varuse to inhibit warning)

vaccination_drive_main.c:59:8: Suspected infinite loop.  No value used in loop
    test (choice3) is modified by test or loop body.
  This appears to be an infinite loop. Nothing in the body of the loop or the
  loop test modifies the value of the loop test. Perhaps the specification of a
  function called in the loop body is missing a modification. (Use -infloops to
  inhibit warning)
